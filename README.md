[Sentosa AutoForms](http://learningmason.wordpress.com/)

Sentosa AutoForms aims to provide a web interface for databases, with forms, subforms, tables and reports, etc.

## Getting Started

August 2015: It's still very early in development. Please come back soon, I have some code but not much to show now. Some basic interface will be ready around half of September 2015.

## License

I'm using this bootstrap admin template [SB Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/)

## My blog

I started this project because:

* I'm interested in databases
* I actually need a simple web interface for my databases. Other apps I tried didn't suit my needs.
* I find [Mason](http://www.masonhq.com) a great and powerful Perl-based templating system, and I want to learn how to use it better

I'm documenting the developement process here:
